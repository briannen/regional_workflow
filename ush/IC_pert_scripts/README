Steps for running the SRW app workflow to add 30h GEFS forecast derived perturbations to an RRFS-like ensemble

0. Check out and build the app:
    - git clone -b rrfs_ens_design https://github.com/dtcenter/ufs-srweather-app.git
    - checkout externals and build with devbuild.sh

1a. Generate the 10-member ensemble workflow with HRRR ICs, which is the "RRFS analog"
    - use config.sh_IC_perts
    - copy input.nml_IC_pert_merra2 to the experiment directory and replace input.nml with it
    - can be run through make_ics but stop booting tasks before run_fcst

1b. Generate "GEFS" workflow 9 separate times with GFS ICs
    - use config.sh_IC_perts_GEFS
    - run *only* get_extrn_ics to start

2*. pull gefs 30h forecasts (or whatever forecast length we decide one) from AWS or HPSS
    - use get_gefs_rrfs.sh to pull data and cat the "a" and "b" files 
    - potential duplicate grib2 entries can cause a problem?
    - NOTE: this should already be done and staged in this path: /scratch2/BMC/fv3lam/ens_design_RRFS/data/GEFS/pgrb2_combined_bn

2. use cp_gefs_ics.sh to replace the GFS IC files with staged GEFS 30h forecasts
    - edit paths
    - then, launch all 9 GEFS workflows through make_ics

3. Calculate the gefs IC perturbations with calc_perts.sh
    - edit path to GEFS experiment dir area
    - applies to gfs_data, gfs_bndy (f000 only), and sfc_data
    * TODO: it might be best to submit this as a batch job but I suspect it will need extra memory!

4. Use add_soil_layers.sh (runs soil_regrid.py) to interpolate the 4 layer NOAH LSM (GFS) soil variables in sfc_data to 9 levels as in RUC LSM (HRRR)
    - edit path to the GEFS perts area
    - this will create new "_soil_9_layers" surface perturbation files

5. use apply_perts.sh to add the perturbations to the HRRR_ICs
    - edit paths to GEFS perts AND RRFS ensemble experiments
    - it uses add_ic_pert.py

6. continue running the "RRFS analog" ensemble workflow
    make sure no members are failing!


NOTES: 

*do you have access to hpss rstprod? If so, you can set config.sh to pull the obs to be used in vx. if not, that will need to be done first by someone with accesss and then change the config files to used staged obs! Currently it is set to use staged obs.

*the RRFS fix files are in /scratch2/BMC/fv3lam/ens_design_RRFS/FIX_RRFS/am. You may need to copy optics* and aero* from that area into the experiment directory's fix_am directory befroe running the forecast task!
